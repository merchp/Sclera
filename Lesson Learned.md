## Lessons Learned:

#### What did you do right?
I designed a good concept, really thought through the entire software development process, how important version control is

&nbsp;

#### What did you do wrong ?
I didnâ€™t take advantage of the collaboration we had in Discord and during class. I also used an outdated SDK and scaffolded everything all wrong. My GitHub commits got lost in the constant scrapping of project folders and solutions. I lost most of my viable code during this. I also found it hard to get logic down with my assessment/survey and it was hard to get the models and controllers to play nicely. 

&nbsp;

#### Where were you lucky?
Great design to use when I get time to get this project working and up to date.   

&nbsp;

#### What would you change?
This course would have worked in another timeframe. Lifestyle changes toward the end of the course that slowed me down.
